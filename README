There are three things that will need to be manually configured.

1. config.xml

This is the distributor configuration file that can be exported from the Admin Console.
The sample store will use this file to communicate with the proper distributor and to properly form download links.

2. admin information in requestmaker.php

You will need to enter two pieces of information here. Where it says "ENTER YOUR ADMIN CONSOLE PASSWORD HERE", replace the string
below with the password you use to log in to the Admin Console.
Where it says "ENTER THE URL OF YOUR ADMIN SERVICE HERE", replace the URL with your admin URL. This string should end with "admin/".

3. book of the month

In catalog.php, where it says "ENTER YOUR BOOK OF THE MONTH RESOURCE ID HERE", enter the resource ID of the book that you want
to put in a special display banner. This is optional and if you replace the resource ID below with a blank string, the banner
will simply be omitted from the web page.

You will also need to provide a truncated description for this book. Where it says "ENTER YOUR BOOK OF THE MONTH TRUNCATED DESCRIPTION HERE",
replace the text between the <p></p> tags with a partial description of your book. It should not be longer than the string already there.
